I realized there was no current API with the latest stats, so I went ahead and built one! Of course, I also built a react client to showcase the data in a meaningful way, I am first and foremost a frontend dev. Using Django and DRF to build the backend API was an experience for sure, I hit quite a bit of stumbling blocks and had to do a lot of googling but in the end, it came together quite nicely. I am hoping to make this an overwatch one-stop-shop for players, especially the API, with more info about maps, plot, comics and more!"},"demo":"https://overwatch-heroes.netlify.app/","github":"https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/overwatch-heroes","screenshots":[{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/jvZkHGBpSL7FOIZ8C8hwg/597e2cb3d77c9733bd98793422a69eaa/screenshot-overwatch-heroes.netlify.app-2020.10.14-09_31_55.png"},"description":"All heroes"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/38wWBXSXQYwQODaBn50FU1/2ee05c8ef62f86a2676cfef0f2c59dc5/screenshot-overwatch-heroes.netlify.app-2020.10.14-09_31_5512.png"},"description":"Filter Tank"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/3DbCjKzecO05cmOFG2qTFd/c09bffd0d9f67e076788476eee0aaa59/ljasd.png"},"description":"Filter - Damage"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/3Q1xXmgceHrsRgm5W7H7v7/c5a8373d06807d3c9e1cea29ff1c674c/screenshot-overwatch-heroes.netlify.app-2020.10.14-09_31_5523.png"},"description":"Filter - Support"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/3K6F1SYIWsYuHPNXB0rOeL/9e7a5d5eedad26df5ff9795f98b54643/screenshot-overwatch-heroes.netlify.app-2020.10.14-09_31_55sdvfdf.png"},"description":"Hero Ultimate"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/3bfymIJ8K6a35S84cX2JZa/8b0152a5611fc57b581797863b6fc5f1/screenshot-overwatch-heroes.netlify.app-2020.10.14-sdsdsds.png"},"description":"Abilities"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/2uM17uoEzyt4KbIPS8ydMq/b76201aae11131e14c5f9564d86f8758/download.png"},"description":"Hero profile"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/48qREs8OJ1uIe15ChP65Ri/c13e9c05a12040ffca5e28cb3fe05f7d/API_preview_heroes.png"},"description":"API - list of all the heroes, and their preview images."},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/7vrEI5XPDM1iCiCj12vb9d/98fad103f67afa1a8518783f099db0a1/API_hero_data.png"},"description":"An instance of a hero data (Ashe).
