It has every CRUD flow. I built this as one of my first big projects, I was okay with react but I didn't know node, I built this as a part of a course on Udemy as a learning exercise. The frontend was built by me entirely, including the design. This was built a while ago and it's definitely not my best project, but I think it's important to see how far I've come since then. I will try and update the design in the near future. The API is the real focus for this project, and that I think, still holds up and the skills I've learned from this I still carry with me.\n\nNote - heroku might take a few seconds to spin up the machine from sleep since its a free tier, should only happen once."},"demo":"https://sheltered-wave-26859.herokuapp.com/","github":"https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/devconnect","screenshots":[{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/3LwBy1w3zSJR9cq0Zm0nZe/6561b25776f3fabd10342159da699769/User_dashboard.png"},"description":"User dashboard"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/250RKfx9LS1gLygkTbVuYw/eac4bfc759ccd729e7b9df2853fe188e/landing.png"},"description":"Landing page"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/7h8lfaVclMiJldBPeHIWU6/68c75af0d4e8fa24fe342b0bef2ff797/login.png"},"description":"Login screen"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/4ouRZEl9ADvzSbStOF3PbB/e5bc652099647a98064196c74d174f31/register.png"},"description":"Register screen"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/3Iq8k35d0ZmCUwIXuzSjuU/dfbe847a330edbb899c415071cafab34/profiles.png"},"description":"All user profiles"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/7GUs9Ya2DC4NQ0jhWi8qFF/14b6d850942a55ab09744769a676f167/Add_education.png"},"description":"Add education screen"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/70U2VZs8d0rSjET2gyBkaM/155d7a03ab4ec9f9b4ddd7e066ab2fc2/Add_experience.png"},"description":"Add experience screen"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/6z5If4tRG7kzkfHj9pufDY/5645e821c56a3d5d61cef85d0e730d38/Single_post_and_comments.png"},"description":"Single post, with comments"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/1fwyk8IpTVuKK27FXB99cI/3f07c2c0d843378e965c2e8c75ade712/User_profile.png"},"description":"User profile\n"},{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/5CnrAl4GYRj4dR8WGkaDLM/e4028cf534002165f30f50ffe5514c11/User_posts.png"},"description":"All user posts"}],"questions":[{"question":"Why build this?","answer":"I built this to familiarize myself with user-built APIs and learn node.
