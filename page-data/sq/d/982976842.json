It has every CRUD flow. I built this as one of my first big projects, I was okay with react but I didn't know node, I built this as a part of a course on Udemy as a learning exercise. The frontend was built by me entirely, including the design. This was built a while ago and it's definitely not my best project, but I think it's important to see how far I've come since then. I will try and update the design in the near future. The API is the real focus for this project, and that I think, still holds up and the skills I've learned from this I still carry with me.\n\nNote - heroku might take a few seconds to spin up the machine from sleep since its a free tier, should only happen once."},"slug":"devconnect"}},{"node":{"projectName":"Overwatch Heroes","demo":"https://spoofify-with-react.netlify.app/","github":"https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/remote-spotify","thumbnail":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/4vvVwIPRfWt0M7hGofIrgC/4213a6aa4ee54d054670493713f1ce49/thumbnail.png"}},"projectDescription":{"projectDescription":"Overwatch Heroes is an API focused project that I built to be able to get all the information about these characters in one place. I realized there was no current API with the latest stats, so I went ahead and built one! Of course, I also built a react client to showcase the data in a meaningful way, I am first and foremost a frontend dev. Using Django and DRF to build the backend API was an experience for sure, I hit quite a bit of stumbling blocks and had to do a lot of googling but in the end, it came together quite nicely. I am hoping to make this an overwatch one-stop-shop for players, especially the API, with more info about maps, plot, comics and more!"},"slug":"overwatch-heroes"}},{"node":{"projectName":"Spoofify - a Spotify clone","demo":"https://overwatch-heroes.netlify.app/","github":"https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/overwatch-heroes","thumbnail":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/1Ip4JILvSQ1ubkHU4k58zI/89e0df022b26794ff2782f2a699542c0/thumbnail.png"}},"projectDescription":{"projectDescription":"Spoofify is a web app built to emulate virtually anything the real spotify app can do. Built from the ground up with react, redux and react-router, this app has full functionality, including browsing, playing, skipping and following playlists, tracks and more! This was an exercise to hone and showcase my skills as a frontend developer and it was a lot of fun to build something that I can use everyday. I want this to be as capable as the real thing, so I will be continually updating it with new features and designs. Do check out the site [here](https://spoofify-with-react.netlify.app/ \"Spoofify\") and a full repo [here](https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/remote-spotify \"Spoofify github repo\"). \nNote - Only premium users can control playback through the API. This is not a limitation with my app, but the spotify API. Normal users can still login, see their playback and save their tracks!"},"slug":"spoofify"}}]}}}
