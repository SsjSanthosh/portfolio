Built from the ground up with react, redux and react-router, this app has full functionality, including browsing, playing, skipping and following playlists, tracks and more! This was an exercise to hone and showcase my skills as a frontend developer and it was a lot of fun to build something that I can use everyday. I want this to be as capable as the real thing, so I will be continually updating it with new features and designs. Do check out the site [here](https://spoofify-with-react.netlify.app/ \"Spoofify\") and a full repo [here](https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/remote-spotify \"Spoofify github repo\"). \nNote - Only premium users can control playback through the API. This is not a limitation with my app, but the spotify API. Normal users can still login, see their playback and save their tracks!"},"slug":"spoofify"}},{"node":{"projectName":"Overwatch Heroes ","liveSite":{"json":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"https://overwatch-heroes.netlify.app/","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"githubRepo":{"json":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"https://github.com/SsjSanthosh/overwatch-heroes-react","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"thumbnail":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/a5oaq7ado59z/4vvVwIPRfWt0M7hGofIrgC/4213a6aa4ee54d054670493713f1ce49/thumbnail.png"}},"projectDescription":{"projectDescription":"Overwatch Heroes is an API focused project that I built to be able to get all the information about these characters in one place. I realized there was no current API with the latest stats, so I went ahead and built one! Of course, I also built a react client to showcase the data in a meaningful way, I am first and foremost a frontend dev. Using Django and DRF to build the backend API was an experience for sure, I hit quite a bit of stumbling blocks and had to do a lot of googling but in the end, it came together quite nicely. I am hoping to make this an overwatch one-stop-shop for players, especially the API, with more info about maps, plot, comics and more!"},"slug":"overwatch-heroes"}}]}}}
